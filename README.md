# Mental Health Survey (MHS) Analysis
Situation
The Mental Health Survey (MHS) dataset captures responses about the mental health conditions of individuals in the workplace. It includes information on factors such as workplace environment, mental health support availability, and the respondents' openness about discussing mental health issues. The goal of analyzing this data is to understand the prevailing attitudes toward mental health in the workplace and identify areas where support and awareness can be improved.

Task
The objective was to conduct an analysis of the MHS dataset to:

Understand the demographics and distribution of mental health issues within workplaces.
Identify correlations between workplace support, openness, and the likelihood of individuals seeking help.
Draw insights that can guide companies in creating better mental health support frameworks for their employees.
Action
Data Preprocessing:

Addressed missing data by imputing values where possible and removing irrelevant columns.
Standardized the format of responses for consistency in analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized the distribution of responses by gender, age, and region to understand the demographic spread.
Analyzed key factors like the availability of mental health resources, comfort level in discussing mental health with supervisors, and the company's stance on mental health.
Investigated correlations between the availability of resources and the likelihood of employees seeking treatment or support.
Statistical Analysis and Modeling:

Applied correlation analysis to identify significant relationships between company policies and employee openness about mental health.
Developed logistic regression models to predict whether an individual would seek help based on workplace support and personal attitudes toward mental health.
Assessed model performance using accuracy metrics to ensure reliable predictions.
Visualization and Interpretation:

Created bar charts and heatmaps to visualize the relationship between mental health support availability and reported well-being.
Highlighted key factors that positively influence the likelihood of seeking support, including transparent communication and access to resources.
Result
The analysis revealed that employees in environments with open discussions about mental health and accessible resources are significantly more likely to seek help.
A strong correlation was identified between the perceived supportiveness of the work environment and the willingness of employees to disclose mental health concerns.
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of around 75%, effectively capturing the key predictors of seeking mental health support in the workplace.
Recommendations include implementing training programs for supervisors, offering anonymous support channels, and promoting awareness initiatives to foster a culture of mental health support.
Conclusion
The MHS analysis provides valuable insights into how workplace environments can influence mental health outcomes. By focusing on improving access to resources and fostering a supportive culture, companies can play a crucial role in enhancing the mental well-being of their employees. This analysis serves as a foundation for guiding organizations in creating better policies and fostering a healthier workplace environment.
